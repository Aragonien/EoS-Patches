# EoS-Patches
This repository contains ASM and C special processes I've written for EoS. Every process is compatible with EU and US versions, unless stated otherwise in the file name.

# C Special Processes
The C special processes are designed to be used as part of [c-of-time](https://github.com/SkyTemple/c-of-time/tree/main).
To use these special processes, include their Header files in "special_processes.c" and call their functions.

# ASM Special Processes
These are designed to be used as every other ASM special process for EoS.
